# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Live stock while open
The terminal SHALL send its full content (stock, craftable items, requests, rules) when the game opens the screen, without waiting for the periodic update. The client SHALL keep the last content of each terminal for the session and SHALL show it at once when that terminal is opened again, replacing it when the fresh content arrives; the screen SHALL show a loading hint only while it has no content for that terminal yet. While the GUI is open the stock shown SHALL refresh within half a second after the index changes, without resending when nothing changed.

#### Scenario: Machine output arrives
- **WHEN** a hopper puts 10 bread into a crate while the GUI is open
- **THEN** the bread count rises within a second

#### Scenario: Instant content
- **WHEN** the player opens the terminal
- **THEN** the stock is sent in the same tick the screen opens

#### Scenario: Opened again
- **WHEN** the player closes the terminal and opens it again in the same session
- **THEN** the last stock shows at once without a loading hint and is replaced by the fresh content
