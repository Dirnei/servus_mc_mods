## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Field Head GUI
Right clicking a Field Head SHALL open a GUI with three tabs on the left edge of its panel and the player inventory below the page of the selected tab. The GUI SHALL open on the Field tab, and clicking a tab SHALL show its page; slots of the other pages SHALL be hidden and SHALL NOT take clicks.

The **Field** tab SHALL have a crop picker: a button that shows the field's crop with its icon and name, or "None, harvest only" while the field is in harvest only mode or has no crop, and that opens a scrollable list with a search field over the GUI. The list SHALL hold every item that places a crop block, mods' crops included, sorted by name, after a first entry "None, harvest only". Typing in the search field SHALL narrow the list to the entries whose name or id contains the text. Choosing a crop entry SHALL set that crop and turn harvest only off; choosing "None, harvest only" SHALL set harvest only mode and clear the crop. The player SHALL NOT need the item to choose it. The server SHALL refuse an item that places no crop block and a player who can no longer use the head. The crop and the mode SHALL be kept when the world is saved.

Each crop entry SHALL show how many of that item the warehouse of the served field holds. The counts SHALL reach the player when the GUI opens and again whenever they change while it is open. An entry with no stock SHALL stay selectable but be drawn greyed, with a hint that the first planting needs seeds in the warehouse. A head whose field is not on a warehouse SHALL show no counts.

The Field tab SHALL show the planted and ripe plot counts with the ripe share bar, the harvest threshold with its buttons, whether a harvest is due through the work status line (naming the harvester working the field), or why the head serves no field.

The **Water** tab SHALL show the water level and capacity and whether the field is hydrated or dry. It SHALL have the anti-corrosion upkeep slot and SHALL show the corrosion stage of the served field with the progress toward the next aging step, or, for a corroded field, that the rails are corroded and the field is not watered.

The **Upgrades** tab SHALL have the Range Upgrade slot of the field radius and SHALL show the radius and the field size in rails and plots.

Shift clicking an anti-corrosion item or a Range Upgrade in the player inventory SHALL move it into its slot whatever tab is open, and shift clicking it in its slot SHALL move it back to the inventory.

A tab SHALL carry a red marker while its page holds a problem, so it is seen from every tab: the Field tab while the head serves no field or the work status is a warning, the Water tab while the served field is dry or corroded.

#### Scenario: Opens on the Field tab
- **WHEN** a player opens a Field Head
- **THEN** the Field tab is selected and shows the crop picker, while the Range Upgrade and anti-corrosion slots are hidden

#### Scenario: Set wheat

- **THEN** the field's crop is wheat and harvest only is off

#### Scenario: Harvest only clears the crop
- **WHEN** wheat is set and the player chooses "None, harvest only"

#### Scenario: Refuse a non seed
- **WHEN** a client sends the id of cobblestone as the chosen crop
- **THEN** the crop and the mode do not change

#### Scenario: Modded crops listed
- **WHEN** a mod adds a seed item that places a crop block
- **THEN** that seed appears in the crop picker list in name order

#### Scenario: Search narrows the list
- **WHEN** the player types "carr" in the picker's search field
- **THEN** the list shows Carrot and the "None, harvest only" entry

#### Scenario: Stock shown and greyed
- **WHEN** the warehouse holds 40 wheat seeds and no beetroot seeds and the player opens the picker
- **THEN** Wheat Seeds shows 40 and Beetroot Seeds is greyed with the hint that the first planting needs seeds in the warehouse

#### Scenario: Stock follows the warehouse
- **WHEN** wheat seeds are put into the warehouse while the GUI is open
- **THEN** the Wheat Seeds count in the picker updates without reopening the GUI

#### Scenario: No warehouse, no counts
- **WHEN** a player opens the picker of a head whose field is not on a warehouse
- **THEN** the entries show no counts and none is greyed

#### Scenario: Radius shown
- **WHEN** a player opens the Upgrades tab of a head holding one Range Upgrade with `radius` 2
- **THEN** the tab shows radius 3

#### Scenario: Corroded field shown
- **WHEN** a player opens the GUI of a head whose field is corroded
- **THEN** the Water tab has a red marker and its page says the rails are corroded and the field is not watered

#### Scenario: Honeycomb by hand
- **WHEN** a player shift clicks honeycomb in the head's GUI while the Field tab is open
- **THEN** the honeycomb moves into the anti-corrosion slot

#### Scenario: Range Upgrade back to the inventory
- **WHEN** a player shift clicks the Range Upgrade in its slot on the Upgrades tab
- **THEN** it moves back to the player inventory

#### Scenario: Dry field marked
- **WHEN** a head serving a field runs out of water while the player looks at the Upgrades tab
- **THEN** the Water tab shows a red marker
