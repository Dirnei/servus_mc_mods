# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Storage blocks join through rails
Every rail SHALL be a node of the warehouse network. Crates, shelving racks, warehouse controllers and counter terminals touching a rail on any side SHALL belong to the same network as that rail, and a chain of connected rails SHALL carry membership along its whole length. Rails SHALL link to each other sideways only; a rail directly above another rail does not link to it.

#### Scenario: Two aisles one controller
- **WHEN** a controller touches a rail, the rail runs ten blocks, and racks stand beside the rail at both ends
- **THEN** all racks and the controller form one online warehouse and the counter terminal lists their contents

#### Scenario: Rail removed
- **WHEN** a rail in the middle of that run is broken
- **THEN** the racks past the gap leave the controller's network and their items leave the index

#### Scenario: Stacked rails
- **WHEN** a rail lies on a block directly above another rail and nothing else joins them
- **THEN** the two rails are in different networks

### Requirement: Rail is obtainable and dismantled
The rail SHALL be craftable from vanilla materials in a batch, SHALL drop itself when broken, SHALL drop itself when the block under it is removed, and SHALL be dismantled by sneaking with the Configuration Carrot.

#### Scenario: Crafting
- **WHEN** the player places iron ingots and a stick in the rail pattern (for example two rows of three ingots around a stick)
- **THEN** the result is several rails (for example eight)

#### Scenario: Sneak dismantle
- **WHEN** the player sneaks and uses the Configuration Carrot on a rail
- **THEN** the rail drops as an item

#### Scenario: Floor removed
- **WHEN** the block under a rail is broken
- **THEN** the rail drops as an item
