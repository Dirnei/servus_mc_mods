# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Duct GUI
Using the Configuration Carrot, not sneaking, on an arm of a duct that touches an inventory or machine SHALL open the endpoint GUI for that side. It SHALL show the side and the touched block's name, one tab per present line on its left edge showing the line's item, and the page of the selected tab: the line's mode button, the eight channel cells with the current channel framed, and a remove button; the Item Pipe page also the filter slots and the priority with minus and plus buttons. The player inventory SHALL be shown under every page. Filter slots SHALL be hidden and inert on the Power Cable page. Using the carrot on the centre or on an arm toward another duct SHALL open nothing. Bare hand right click SHALL open nothing.

#### Scenario: Configure one side
- **WHEN** the player uses the carrot on the west arm that touches a chest, sets the item mode to pull in and places cobblestone in a filter slot
- **THEN** the duct pulls only cobblestone from the west

#### Scenario: Two lines, two tabs
- **WHEN** the player opens the GUI of a duct with an Item Pipe and a Power Cable
- **THEN** two tabs show, the Item Pipe page is selected, and clicking the Power Cable tab shows its mode, channels and remove button without filter slots

#### Scenario: Duct to duct arm
- **WHEN** the player uses the carrot on an arm that leads to another duct
- **THEN** no GUI opens

#### Scenario: Bare hand
- **WHEN** the player right clicks a duct with an empty hand
- **THEN** no GUI opens and the click passes through
